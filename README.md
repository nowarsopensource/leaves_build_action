## Automatically compile Leaves|自动编译Leaves
You can download the automatically compiled Leaves server jar file, which uses the [Leaves](https://leavesmc.org/software/leaves) repository to build the default branch, and if there is a dev branch, it will build the dev branch (in general, after the dev branch, the original master branch will be ushered in a long period of time without updates). until the dev branch is merged into the master branch). When it is done, it will be released to [Release](https://github.com/nowarsopensource/leaves_build_action/releases) in this repository.  



------------

你可以下载自动编译的Leaves服务端jar文件，它使用[Leaves](https://leavesmc.io/software/leaves)仓库默认分支构建,如果存在dev分支，则会构建dev分支(一般情况下有dev分支后原master分支将会迎来长时间的不更新，直到dev分支合并到了master分支)。并在完成后发布到此仓库的[Release](https://github.com/nowarsopensource/leaves_build_action/releases)中。
